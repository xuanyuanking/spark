/**

 * Except for the final merge, which merges disk blocks to a returned iterator, TieredDiskMerger
 * merges blocks from disk to disk.

 * TieredDiskMerger carries out disk-to-disk merges in a background thread that can run concurrently

 *
 * When deciding which blocks to merge, it first tries to minimize the number of blocks, and then
